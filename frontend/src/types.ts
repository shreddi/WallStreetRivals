//Different datatypes for WSR frontend, based on the data received from backend via GET requests. 
//Fields that are generated by backend after creation (id, timecreated, timeupdated, etc) are designated with a '?' so they can be undefined for when we are constructing a new object to be created by the backend
//Django serializes DecimalField as strings, so things like trade_price, total_value, and holdings_value are strings. If desired, this could be changed by using parseFloat in apiService.

//Parent interface that defines common properties shared by all other interfaces in this file.
//These properties include universally applicable fields such as 'id', 'time_created', and 'time_updated'.
